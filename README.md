# ai-mental-health-monitor
Final project for the Building AI course by Reaktor and University of Helsinki

Summary
An AI system that identifies early warning signs of student mental health struggles by analyzing language patterns, behavioral data, and engagement trends from digital platforms, enabling timely support by school counselors.
Building AI course project

Background
Mental health issues among students, including anxiety, depression, and burnout, are increasingly common and often go unnoticed until they escalate. Traditional support systems rely heavily on self-reporting or visible symptoms, which delays intervention.
Students hesitate to seek help due to stigma
Schools lack the resources for continuous monitoring
Early intervention can drastically improve outcomes
As someone who has seen peers struggle silently, I believe AI can play a vital role in proactive mental health support.

How is it used?
The system is integrated with digital tools students already use (e.g., learning management systems, chat platforms, submission portals). It uses natural language processing (NLP) and behavior analytics to detect patterns such as:
Negative sentiment in messages
Decrease in participation or productivity
Unusual sleep/activity hours based on digital usage
Alerts are triggered only when a threshold is met, and they are sent confidentially to school counselors—not to teachers or peers. The system is designed to preserve student privacy while enabling early support.

Data sources and AI methods
Data sources (with privacy and consent):
Anonymized message logs from school chat apps
Assignment submission timestamps
LMS engagement logs

AI methods:
NLP (sentiment analysis, topic modeling)
Time-series analysis for engagement patterns
Anomaly detection
This project could use open datasets like CLPsych for language modeling on mental health signals, and simulated LMS logs for prototyping.

Challenges
Privacy – Extreme care must be taken to ensure student data is protected and anonymized.
False positives/negatives – Not all behavioral changes indicate distress; balance is key.
Ethical use – The system must not become a surveillance tool. Human judgment is essential for any action.
Consent – Opt-in mechanisms are critical.

What next?
Build a proof-of-concept using synthetic data
Partner with educators and psychologists for evaluation
Improve accuracy by incorporating feedback
Add language support for multilingual schools
Open-source the project under a responsible AI license
