# AI-Powered Early Detection of Student Mental Health Issues

## Summary
An AI system that identifies early signs of mental health struggles among students using NLP and behavioral analytics. Helps school counselors offer timely, confidential support.

This is a final project for the Building AI course.

## Background

Mental health issues among students—such as anxiety, depression, and burnout—often go unnoticed until they become severe. Traditional support systems rely on students seeking help, which many are hesitant to do due to stigma or lack of awareness.

This project addresses:
* Undetected early warning signs in students
* Limited capacity of schools to monitor individual well-being
* The need for privacy-preserving proactive support systems

**Personal motivation:** I’ve seen classmates silently suffer and believe AI can offer a compassionate, preventive solution. Education and mental well-being must go hand in hand.

## How is it used?

The system integrates with existing school tools like Learning Management Systems (LMS), chat apps, and submission portals. It monitors patterns such as:

* Drop in assignment quality or submission delays
* Decrease in engagement or participation
* Change in tone/sentiment in messages or submissions

When signs of distress are detected, an alert is sent to school counselors — not to teachers or peers — preserving privacy while enabling early intervention.

## What data is used?

* Student messages (text-based) from LMS discussion boards and chat systems
* Assignment submission timestamps and frequency
* Optional self-assessment surveys

Data is anonymized and used under school data policies or with informed consent.

## How does it work?

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** analyzes message sentiment and emotion.
* **Behavioral analytics** track trends in participation and performance.
* A **machine learning model** is trained to detect high-risk patterns from past anonymized cases.

If concerning patterns arise, a counselor is notified through a secure dashboard.

## What are the limitations?

* May produce false positives/negatives due to context gaps
* Requires responsible and ethical deployment to avoid misuse
* Cultural and language diversity may impact accuracy — model needs local tuning

## Ethical considerations

* Privacy-first design: All alerts are confidential and never shown to peers or teachers.
* Students and parents must be informed and provide consent before participation.
* No grading or disciplinary action is based on AI outputs.

## Future work

* Expand model to include voice/video sentiment (with consent)
* Improve accuracy with larger, diverse datasets
* Build an open-source dashboard for school counselors
